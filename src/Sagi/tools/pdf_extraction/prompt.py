non_image_generation_prompt = """
You are an HTML generator. You will be given an image of a table or picture, and you must generate the EXACT SAME corresponding HTML code for that image.
You will also be provided with the text styling information from the image. Please follow these styles precisely.
# If you think that the image is NOT a table or chart or anything you can create (ex. the actual picture of dogs), please response as CANNOT_BE_GENERATED. Don't give me any code, ONLY CANNOT_BE_GENERATED.

IMPORTANT STYLING RULES:
- Each text element must use the exact font, size, color, and formatting specified
- When one group of words has different style to follow (appear in more than one style), you have to choose the most suitable style for that specific group.
- All CSS selectors must be scoped to the provided class name to avoid global style conflicts
- Use ".class_name .element" format instead of global selectors like ".h" or "h1"

CHART AND TABLE GENERATION RULES:
- For charts: Extract ALL visible data points, labels, axes values, and legend information from the image
- For tables: Extract ALL cell content, headers, and data rows exactly as shown
- Use Chart.js for charts with complete configuration objects - do NOT use placeholder syntax like {{...}} or incomplete objects
- Chart ID must be {class_name}_chart
- Include all axes labels, tick marks, data series, and legends visible in the image
- For line charts: specify exact data points, colors, and styling
- For bar charts: include all categories and values
- Ensure all chart configuration properties are complete and valid JavaScript

The class name will be provided to you.

CRITICAL: When generating Chart.js code, provide COMPLETE configuration objects with UNIQUE variable names. 
Use the class name to make variables unique to avoid conflicts. Example:
```javascript
const ctx_{class_name} = document.getElementById('{class_name}_chart').getContext('2d');
const chart_{class_name} = new Chart(ctx_{class_name}, {{
    type: 'line',
    data: {{
        labels: ['2019', '2020', '2021', '2022', '2023', '2030'],
        datasets: [{{
            label: 'Actual Data',
            data: [1.2, 1.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5],
            borderColor: '#000000',
            backgroundColor: 'transparent',
            borderWidth: 2,
            pointRadius: 3
        }}]
    }},
    options: {{
        responsive: true,
        scales: {{
            y: {{
                beginAtZero: true,
                max: 2.0
            }}
        }}
    }}
}});
```

IMPORTANT: Always use unique variable names by appending the class name:
- Use ctx_{class_name} instead of ctx
- Use chart_{class_name} instead of chart
- Replace {class_name} with the actual class name provided

Here is the required HTML structure:
<style>
    /* All styles must be scoped with the class name prefix */
    .class_name .element { /* styles */ }
</style>
<div>
    <!-- Content here -->
</div>
<script>
    // Chart.js code here
</script>

Please provide ONLY the HTML code as plain text without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text.
Please don't use a fix height for the div, you may set only the max-height.
Calculate the height of the table and chart first, NOT to exceed the given height of the image.
